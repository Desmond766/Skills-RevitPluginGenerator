# Autodesk.Revit.DB.GlobalParameter

This class represents a GlobalParameter element in Revit.

## Syntax (C#)
```csharp
public class GlobalParameter : ParameterElement
```

## Remarks
Global parameters can be used to drive values of dimensions or other elements' parameters.
 Also, a global parameter can be driven by a selected dimension, the value of which then
 determines the value of the global parameter. Such parameters can further be used to drive
 values of other elements' parameters. 
See also the GlobalParametersManager class for methods
 that operate upon global parameters of a document, such as getting all defined global
 parameters and testing whether a global parameter of certain name already exists or not.
Reporting vs. Non-Reporting parameters There are several ways global parameters can be categorized, but probably the most significant
 categorization stems from the IsReporting property which divides global parameters
 into two groups - Reporting and Non-Reporting. The significance of reporting parameters lays in the
 fact that their values are driven by the dimension that has been labeled by a reporting parameter.
 It means that the value of a reporting parameter reflects the value of a dimension (length or angle)
 and gets updated anytime the dimension changes. Non-Reporting parameters behave in the opposite manner
 - they drive value of dimensions that have been labeled by them, which results in controlling
 the model's geometry through global parameters' values. Reporting parameters are limited in several ways. They can be only of Length or Angle type,
 a requirement due to the fact that a dimension must be able to drive the value. For the same reason
 reporting parameters may not have formulas. Non-Reporting parameters, on the other way, can be of almost any type ( Length , Integer ,
 Area , etc.) with the exception of ElementId type. Also, Non-Reporting parameters may have assigned
 formulas in which other global parameters may be used as arguments. This way one global parameter's value
 can be derived from other parameter (or parameters), and the other parameter can be either reporting
 or non-reporting. Creating Global Parameters Global parameters get created via the static method Create(Document, String, ForgeTypeId) . It is important to note that each
 new parameter must have a name that is unique within the document. Parameters are created as non-reporting
 initially, but programmers are free to modify the IsReporting property once a global parameter
 is created and is of an eligible type. The programmer can call the HasValidTypeForReporting () () () 
 when in doubt whether parameters of a certain data type can be made reporting. Note, that a parameter
 may not be made reporting after more than one dimension has been labeled by it. It is because reporting
 parameter can label (and be driven) by one dimension only. An alternative way of making a parameter reporting is via the SetDrivingDimension(ElementId) method which
 labels one dimension by a global parameter and also makes the parameter reporting if it is not reporting yet. Other important properties of global parameters are IsDrivenByDimension and
 IsDrivenByFormula , which are mutually exclusive - a parameter that has a formula
 assigned cannot be driven by a dimension (nor can be reporting) and vice versa. Global Parameters with formulas Like with family parameters, formulas may be assigned to non-reporting global parameters using the
 SetFormula(String) method (paired with GetFormula () () () to query the current formula.)
 Formulas may include all standard arithmetic operations and logical operations (as functions and , or , not .)
 Input to logical operations must be Boolean values (parameters of YesNo type). Consequently, arithmetic
 operations can be applied to numeric values only. While there are no operations supported for string (text)
 arguments, strings can be used as results of a logical If operation. Depending on their type (and units),
 parameters of different value types can be combined. However, unit-less values such as Integer and
 Number (double) may only be combined with each other. Since formulas can get quite complicated,
 the method IsValidFormula(String) is available for the programmer to ensure a formula is valid
 in order to avoid potential exception due to applying an invalid formula. Labeling dimensions Probably the most notable feature of global parameters is their ability to "Label" dimensions,
 a process that establishes dependency of a dimension on a global parameter (or vice versa,
 depending on the reporting status.) One parameter can label any number of dimensions as long
 as the parameter is non-reporting. If the parameter labels a multi-segment dimension, values of all segments
 of this dimension will be equal to the parameter's value. As mentioned above, reporting parameter can label one dimension
 only, and this dimension can have only one segment. Methods and properties related to labeling include: LabelDimension(ElementId) ,
 UnlabelDimension(ElementId) , and GetLabeledDimensions () () () . Also in this set is the
 CanLabelDimension(ElementId) method which indicates whether or not a particular dimension
 can be labeled. Presently, only single linear dimensions and angles are permitted. Elements affected by a Global Parameter Global parameters can be associated with other global parameters as well as regular family instance
 parameters (which may report global parameters as their values via the assignment formula.)
 There are two methods available to find relations among parameters: GetAffectedGlobalParameters () () () 
 and GetAffectedElements () () () . The former returns all other global parameters that refer
 to a particular global parameter in their respective formulas. The other method returns a set
 of all elements of which some parameters are controlled by the global parameter. These two methods
 together with the GetLabeledDimensions () () () can help the programmer in figuring out
 how model elements relate to each other via global parameters. Methods for maintaining associations between element properties and global parameters
 can be found in the Parameter class. Getting and setting the value of a Global Parameter All global parameters, formula-driven, dimension-driven, or independent, have values. A value can
 be obtained by calling the GetValue () () () method. The object returned by that method is an instance
 of one of the classes derived from ParameterValue class. The concrete
 instance is determined by the type of the global parameter (specified upon creation.) Parameters that are
 neither formula-driven nor dimension-driven (reporting) can have a value assigned. The method to use
 is SetValue(ParameterValue) and it accepts the same type of ParameterValue 
 that is returned by SetValue. However, the type can also be deduced easily: Text parameters accept only
 StringParameterValue . Integer and YesNo parameters accept only
 IntegerParameterValue . All other parameters accept only
 DoubleParameterValue .
